# Decision-Trees-for-Regression
In this, you will implement a Decision Tree Regressor from scratch and compare its performance with scikit-learn's implementation. The tasks include preprocessing the Auto MPG dataset, performing hyperparameter tuning using K-fold cross-validation, and evaluating the models with appropriate metrics.
